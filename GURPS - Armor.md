### **Passive Defense (PD)** 

This adds to your defense roll, and represents the fact that some blows will bounce off the armor. PD of armor normally ranges from 1 to 6.

### **Damage Resistance (DR)** 

This is the amount of protection the item gives, in terms of hits subtracted from a blow which strikes you; e.g., if you are hit while wearing DR 6 armor, and the attacker rolls 8 points of damage, only 2 will affect you.
